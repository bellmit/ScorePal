DEVELOP APP
* Change checking of my id to show admin to 'isAdmin' in the user object (set this by hand)
* Do function in firebase that moves submitted messages to area that can be read by admin. (getUser == isAdmin amd put under that ID)
* Change 'points' as a title of a sport to 'something else' - remove it as an option?
* Test the points entry system
* Do and add an Umpyr logo to the top bar
* Do cookies popup?
* Do new images for friends, help and user
* Add adwords to card we show a lot (at least on home page) or on the welcome card.

EXTEND APP
* Have a function in firebase that sends me an email when someone posts a message to the site
https://github.com/firebase/functions-samples/blob/master/quickstarts/email-users/functions/index.js
* Add some actual help to the help card
* Matches <More Details> could show the card hovering next to the button pressed for better context
* Show unread message count next to the friends option in the list if > 0 (will need to update on getting / reading a message)
* Animate the cards in and out when they change (out to the left, in from the right - fading too?)
* Friends - show stats against friend over last 30 days if requested (expand to show table we then populate?)
* Show new badge against any match that is new (recent and not looked at, or just added?)
* Think about intercepting the back button on the browser to prevent leaving the page accidentally
* Connect to social media - post results of match on facebook or tweet it...
* Add personal details to user, age, location, gender, fav sports
* Enable horizontal scroll when too small to show cards (to help on phone)
* add Fast-4 scoring
* Show server and switch ends message (work out doubles serving)
* Add graph of shot history to match breakdown
* Add stats to match breakdown for tennis - breakpoints played/won for example
* Animate the addition of a match so can see it added when submitted
* Add animation to the ScrollTo - add top card on home and scrolls to hide the chips - not great either...
* Show the results of a tie-break on the scoreboard, or at least on the expanded results
* Entering score for live clears selected players
* Add ability to make previous people played connected as friends after the fact
* Stop people from recording score after the win?
* Add events that groups/people can advertise
* Add ability to create and log tournament results
* Show description in match row with more >>> and <<< less buttons to show longer text entry
* Add ability to block/unblock friends
* Enable delete button for all messages from particular user
* Would be nice if it selected the text that was in the box when clicked upon an entry
* enable posts?
-- Limit the size of image one can Post
-- Limit the number of posts per user and for the whole application (task in background?)
* Limit the number of friends a user can have - becommes a group?
* Do groups - admin can add members by email address
* Do Groups you are part of, also requests to join (message?)
* Do locations, places to play / select to play at places
* Do search?
* Change to and buy Scorepal.com
* Full-screen for ScoreEntry (https://github.com/rafrex/fscreen)

FIX BUGS
* Showing messages card from sending message on friends card doesn't change the colour of the menu item (need to call an update function)
* Sending a message to a user should expand the history of that user in the messages card.
